    <h2>Unlock the Secrets of Component Structure</h2>
    <p>Component structure is the backbone of any Next.js project, especially when integrated with Firebase. This guide will help you master the art of organizing your components for a scalable and maintainable application.</p>
    <h3>Are You Ready to Transform Your Next.js Project?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Basic understanding of Next.js and Firebase</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Step 1: Embrace Functional Components</h3>
    <p>Functional components are the future. Learn how to create them and make your codebase cleaner and more efficient.</p>
    <h3>Step 2: Master React Hooks</h3>
    <p>React Hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` are your best friends for state management and side-effects.</p>
    <h3>Step 3: Create Custom Hooks for Firebase</h3>
    <p>Why reinvent the wheel? Create custom hooks to handle Firebase logic and make your components leaner.</p>
    <h3>Step 4: Understand Component Composition</h3>
    <p>Component composition is an art. Learn how to break down your UI into smaller, reusable components.</p>
    <h3>Step 5: Leverage Context API for Global State</h3>
    <p>Global state management is a breeze with React's Context API. Perfect for sharing Firebase user data across components.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>By mastering component structure, you're not just coding; you're crafting an experience. Your Next.js project is now more organized, scalable, and maintainable.</p>
